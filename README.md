# Engine-Project
Previously a repository for my ITU 2019 Graphics Programming project.
Now extended to a renderering engine in combination with a game engine.

## TODOS
1. ~~Fix framebuffer re-creation, keep the object but re-create underlying OpenGL objectes~~
2. Share VAOs between materials using the same mesh (currently creates a new vao per mesh)
3. Fix texture channel management
